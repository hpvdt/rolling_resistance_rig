# Test Procedures

There are two tests that need to both be completed properly for us to be able to characterize the rolling resistance of a given wheel: the coast down test using the spinning drum, and another to determine the moment of inertia for a given wheel.

# Coast Down Test

This is the test most team members imagine the rolling resistance test to be given the imposing apparatus it depends on. In this test the wheel under test is mounted to our rolling resistance assembly and spun up to speed; generally reaching effective speeds of about 100 km/h using the motor powered drum and then power is cut and the coast down is measured. The process is bit more nuanced than that.

To isolate rolling resistance as the factor responsible for slow down from other factors, the wheels are coasted down twice: once in contact with the drum and the other time once the top speed is achieved the wheel is lifted and coasts down in air. Comparing these allows us to isolate the aerodynamic loss since it is the only factor affecting the "separated" coast down, and then we can subtract that effect from the slow down where the wheel is in contact to remove the aerodynamic losses, leaving just rolling resistance losses.

To improve the reliability of our results, these trials are performed twice with the drum is spun in opposing ways since there is a subtle difference in the results if the drum is spun one way or the other. We take the average of the opposing direction data sets to try and cancel out the effect of direction on the data.

Thus for each wheel configuration four data sets are prepared for these trials, these are all needed for post-processing.

1. Contact coast down - drum spun right
2. Separated coast down - drum spun right
3. Contact coast down - drum spun left
4. Separated coast down - drum spun left

# Inertia Test

In addition to the coasting data the moment of inertia for the wheels must be characterized before a rolling resistance can be derived.

*The exact procedure for this is currently being reviewed and will be posted here once settled.*

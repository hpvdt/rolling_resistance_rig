# Rolling Resistance Rig Hardware

The hardware for the test is pretty simple since we have always used two 3-wire sensors to monitor the wheels' rotations. Even so, custom boards have been made to improve the robustness of the system from just a development board and jumpers while also acting as a training exercise for new members interested in electronics.

# Inertia Test Procedure Outline

1. Add washers (m_coin) to wheel spoke and let wheel rotate like a pendulum.
2. Aim to record ~10 oscillations.
3. Upload data according to the procedure in 'analysis'

### Notes About the Data

Due to a previous configuration of the rotation sensors used for the rolling resistance rig, there were two recorded 'ticks' per wheel pendulum period, so alternating event entries were discarded. This has been done manually by altering the saved data to remove the ignored rows and removing the code to do the skipping so that the logic is *[hopefully]* easier to follow down the line.

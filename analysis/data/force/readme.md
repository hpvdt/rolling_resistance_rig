# Force tests

Collection of data collected from some "force" test runs, no link to a specific wheel model. According to Calvin R. these were trials to see the effect varying our wheel loading would have on the results all else being kept the same (wheel and pressure mainly). 35 lbm corresponds to an unloaded rig, 215 lbm fully loaded.

# Rolling Resistance Research

# November 17, 2017

- Testing the Mich. Blue at 50psi
  - Finished the aero coastdown to the right and the full coastdown in both directions
- Testing Mich. Blue at 60psi
  - Finished aero coastdown and full coastdown

### Notes:
- The Michelin Blue tire has a tendency of resonating over 85 km/h. The amplitude is small, though the effect causes noticeable fluctuation (of around 0.5 km/h) in the data for wheel speed. It shouldnâ€™t affect the data analysis significantly.
- Repeating the left aero coastdowns at 60psi- forgot to adjust the wheel circumference. For the right, the correction was applied as a ratio with the correct circumfrence
